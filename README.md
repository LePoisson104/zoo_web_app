- if work on server and database make sure to write it in the server.js and db.js file (group them all together, we can not have more than one server because only one server can run at a time)
- to run the server for any testing, cd into server folder ("cd server") and then type ("npm run dev") this will run nodemon so you don't have to restart the server when make new changes
- when working on server.js file make sure to group differnt medthods (create, read, update, delete) under the commented line 
- when working on the db.js file write you query functions in the dbService class, and when you call it in the server.js file make sure to create and instance of that class so you can have access to the functions
